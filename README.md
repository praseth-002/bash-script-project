# bash-script-project

This is our Operating System group project Bash Script group project.\
This script consists of 6 different bash scripts.
* one.sh : lists all files and directories within a given path.
* two.sh : creates a backup of a file or directory.
* three.sh : counts the amount of files within a given path.
* four.sh : shows the amount of space that a given path has used up.
* five.sh : search for a file within a given path.
* six.sh : compresses files and files in a directory given into compressed.zip.
  
They all are combined into final.sh.
* final.sh : responsible for containing all 6 scripts and also offers a menu for users to select which function they want to do.

Your inputs are also stored in a console.log file.

## How to use
* open up your bash supported terminal.
* navigate to the folder that has the scripts using "cd path/to/script/folder".
* run final.sh with either "bash final.sh" or "./final.sh".
* it will now show you 6 options and you can select the which one you want.
* once entered a number from 1-6 it will guide you through on what to do next.
